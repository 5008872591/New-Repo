What is this repo all about?
I'm not sure what this is suppose to be about but I will answer the questions accordingly.
Why are you learning these skills?
My idea is to learn more hands on skills that will help me land a helpdesk job. If i do not 
succeed in that hopefully I can at least fix people computers on the side from what we learned in the first few weeks.
What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
I learned the basics of bash scripting and I feel a little more comfortable with the way I process challeneges. I still sometimes make things
harder than they reay are.
What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
I really don't have a favorite, they were all pretty challenging for the most part.
How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
Powershell is very powerful. I think it really helps in remote situations.
What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
Powershell since all the job postings normally ask for that.
What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?
I hope to enjoy Python.
